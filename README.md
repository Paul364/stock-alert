# An application using react to alert of stock price events

Create an application that would monitor given stock exchange symbols
and alerts if quotes go up or down.

Use yahoo's API: http://meumobi.github.io/stocks%20apis/2016/03/13/get-realtime-stock-quotes-yahoo-finance-api.html or other that is available for free.

Use react with routing.
Unit tests are a must.
